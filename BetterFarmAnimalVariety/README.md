#### Overview

A content pack is a folder with these files:

- A `manifest.json` (see [content packs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Content_packs) guide)
- A `content.json` which includes the animal categories you want to modify
- Any image assets required by your categories

The `content.json` file has a list of `Categories`. Each entry is called a `category` with an associated `action`. There isn't a limit to the number of categories you can include.

Here is an example of a `content.json` with multiple actions:

```js
{
  "Categories": [
  
    // Update an existing category with a new type
    {
      "Action": "Update",
      "Category": "Dairy Cow",
      "Types": [
        {
          "Type": "White Bull",
          "Data": "1/5/184/186/cow/36/64/64/64/36/64/64/64/1/false/Barn/32/32/32/32/15/5/-1/639/1500/White Bull/Barn",
          "AdultSprite": "assets/White Bull.png",
          "BabySprite": "assets/BabyWhite Bull.png",
          "Localization": {
            "de": [ "Weißer Stier", "Stall" ],
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  
    // Create a brand new category with a new type
    {
      "Action": "Create",
      "Category": "Sport Horse",
      "Types": [
        {
          "Type": "Sport Horse",
          "Data": "3/4/440/-1/grunt/36/64/84/64/36/64/84/64/1/true/Barn/32/32/32/32/15/5/Shears/644/8000/Sport Horse/Barn",
          "AdultSprite": "assets/Sport Horse.png",
          "BabySprite": "assets/BabySport Horse.png",
          "ShearedSprite": "assets/ShearedSport Horse.png",
        },
      ],
      "Buildings": [
        "Deluxe Barn"
      ],
      "AnimalShop": {
        "Name": "Sport Horse",
        "Description": "They love cave carrots and being groomed.",

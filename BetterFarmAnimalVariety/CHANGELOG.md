## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Support for [BFAV content packs](https://github.com/paritee/Paritee.StardewValley.Frameworks/tree/bfav-3.0.0/BetterFarmAnimalVariety#content-packs)
- Full [harvest type](https://github.com/paritee/Paritee.StardewValley.FarmAnimals/tree/bfav-3.0.0#harvest-types) (i.e. `lay`, `tool`, `find`, `none`) support for any animal type via its data value string
- Applied the `<Days To Produce>` [data value](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Animal_data#Basic_format) to all harvest types instead of just the `lay` type
- Full language support
- Integration with [MoreAnimals 3.x](https://github.com/Entoarox/StardewMods/tree/master/MoreAnimals) for animal skins
- Integration with [JsonAssets 1.x](https://github.com/spacechase0/JsonAssets) for animal produce by item name
- Support for integration with [FarmExpansion 3.x](https://github.com/AdvizeGH/FarmExpansion)
- Farm animal data sanitation on game save to preserve clean saves and recover from dirty saves using save data
- The following APIs: `IsEnabled`, `GetFarmAnimalCategories`, `GetAnimalShopStock`, `GetAnimalShopIcons`, `GetRandomAnimalShopType`, `GetFarmAnimalTypeHistory`
- Support for backwards-compatible `config.json` migration from `Format:2` to  `Format:3`
- A [changelog](https://github.com/paritee/Paritee.StardewValley.Frameworks/tree/bfav-3.0.0/BetterFarmAnimalVariety)

### Changed
- Farm animal categories are managed through [BFAV content packs](https://github.com/paritee/Paritee.StardewValley.Frameworks/tree/bfav-3.0.0/BetterFarmAnimalVariety#content-packs) and not the `config.json`
- All baby animals' types are chosen based on category and produce restrictions. [Non-producing animals](https://github.com/paritee/Paritee.StardewValley.FarmAnimals/tree/bfav-3.0.0#harvest-types) are still supported while specifying the default and deluxe produce to support this change
- In the purchase animals menu, use the lowest price to determine if the player can afford the category. Animals that the player cannot afford will not be in the rotation. If at least one type, but not all, is available for purchase, the totals will be displayed in the description of the category on hover
- The animal type's price will be the actual cost of the animal instead of the category cost. The animal type's price in a scroll on building selection screen
- Messages for hatched egg Coop event are type-agnostic
- Animals that already exist will have content pack updates automatically applied to them instead of only being applied to new animals

### Removed
- Configuration for `VoidFarmAnimalsInShop`; should be handled by other content packs and mods
- Configuration for `RandomizeNewbornFromCategory`, `RandomizeHatchlingFromCategory` and `IgnoreParentProduceCheck`
- All commands except for `bfav_list`
- The following APIs: `GetGroupedFarmAnimals`, `GetBlueFarmAnimals`, `GetVoidFarmAnimals`, `GetAnimalShop`

### Fixed
- Crash when navigating away from saves screen without tapping a save to load

## [2.2.2] - 2019-02-08

## [2.2.1] - 2019-02-08
### Added
- Guards to commands that shouldn't be done after a save is loaded
- Substitute any farm animals whose types cannot be found in `Data/FarmAnimals` on game launch. A crash would happen if the patch's mod folder was deleted, but the animals remained

If IgnoreParentProduceCheck is off, this means that a white egg could hatch into a Brown Chicken. If randomize is est to true, non-producing animals will be included like bulls and roosters
